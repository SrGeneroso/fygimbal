Modes for param18
-----------------

Values are 0-6 inclusive.

0 = off
1 = normal
2 = lowest level direct motor drive using param4e, simulated cal1 angle rate in param4f
3 = drive tim2 controller using input from param50, also use param1d/1e during init
4 = lowest level direct motor drive using param4e, with real cal1 angle
5 = Run like mode3 for a single tick, then go back to mode1
6 = lowest level direct motor drive using param4e, cal1 assumed zero, writes param49

CAL1 procedure:
   - Run in mode 6 until cogging stabilized,
   - store any of the 6 cogging points as CAL1 for this axis.
     (Using cmd0C or by manually writing to param space.)
   - Optional, save to flash memory with cmd05.
